# CONJECTURES:
- The Random player with a higher accuracy will win >50% of the time, even if they start in a losing position
- Random vs. Random with equal accuracies leads to approx. 50% and 50% win rates
- Large accuracies means higher effective win rates (obviously) but longer times to converge to given accuracy
- Winning position seems to affect accuracy minimally with large sizes 
    - 0.9 (w) v. 0.8 ~= 0.68, 0.8 (w) v. 0.9 ~= 0.32 = 1 - 0.68
